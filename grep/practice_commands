- same effect
grep 'Linux' motd
perl -wnl -e '/Linux/ and print;' motd

- data can be retrieved from input file names Or standard input, 
- which makes pipeline work possible
cat motd | perl -wnl -e '/Linux/ and print;'

- display unmatched records
grep -v 'linux' motd

- search current directory recursively (l option for showing file name only)
grep -l -r 'linux' .

- using perl to search multiple keywords with any order is more efficient than grep
- grep/egrep version (note: The symbols \< and \> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.)
egrep '\<ESR\>' projects | egrep '\<SRV\>' | egrep '\<CYA\>'
- perl version, no pipeline needed
perl -wnl -e '/\bESR\b/ and /\bSRV\b/ and /\bCYA\b/ and print;' projects

-- paragraph mode
-- grep cannot show the context of the selected keyword, while perl can use paragraph mode 
grep 'Consultix' companies 
perl -00  -wnl -e '/Consultix/ and print;' companies
